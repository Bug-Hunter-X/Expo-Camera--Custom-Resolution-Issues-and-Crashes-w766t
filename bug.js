This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom resolutions.  The issue is that setting a custom resolution, especially one that is not perfectly divisible by the camera's sensor dimensions, can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes or distorted images.  This is because the camera hardware may not be able to accurately capture and process images at these non-standard resolutions.
